# SwiftUI-News

SwiftUI-News is a simple news app built using SwiftUI. This project demonstrates the use of several key SwiftUI concepts and patterns, including networking, lists, navigation links, the `Identifiable` protocol, and the observer design pattern.

## Features

- **Networking**: Fetches news articles from an API.
- **List**: Displays fetched news articles in a list format.
- **Navigation Link**: Allows users to navigate to detailed views of selected articles.
- **Identifiable Protocol**: Ensures each news article is uniquely identifiable within the list.
- **Observer Design Pattern**: Utilizes SwiftUI's `ObservableObject` to manage state and update views reactively.
